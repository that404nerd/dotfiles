I do not own these files and I just want to use these scripts for improving my i3 WM  and Hyprland workflow. I slightly edited some files (not too much)

Original scripts - https://gitlab.com/vahnrr/rofi-menus/ (ROFI scripts)
Battery scripts -  https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz/dotfiles/tree/master/.local/bin
