Brillo Setup: (Brightness Control)

```bash
sudo vim /etc/udev/rules.d/90-backlight.rules
```

Add the following line to the file:
`ACTION=="add", SUBSYSTEM=="backlight", KERNEL=="intel_backlight", RUN+="/bin/chmod 0666 /sys/class/backlight/%k/brightness"`

If intel_backlight is not the correct backlight device, you might need to check the exact device name in /sys/class/backlight/ and replace intel_backlight with the appropriate name. Then,

```bash
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
sudo udevadm trigger
sudo usermod -aG video $USER
```

### Battery Notifications setup
Additional packages:
```
cronie
acpi
```

For battery notifications (dunst) install `cronie` using your package manager and execute the following command:
`crontab -e`
Add the following line:
`*/10 * * * * /home/username/.local/bin/battery-notify.sh`

Move the `.local/udev_rules/powersave.rules` to `/etc/udev/rules.d/`
And then execute:
`sudo udevadm control --reload`

Replace 10 (time in minutes) with whatever number you want. It checks the battery status every 10 minutes in this case.
