# This is where you put your own keybinds. Be Mindful to check as well ~/.config/hypr/configs/Keybinds.conf to avoid conflict
# if you think I should replace the Pre-defined Keybinds in ~/.config/hypr/configs/Keybinds.conf , submit an issue or let me know in DC and present me a valid reason as to why, such as conflicting with global shortcuts, etc etc
